# Edinburgh-s-Telecom-Terrain-Comparative-Analysis-of-Coverage-by-Leading-Operators
## Description and Miniproject
This analysis leverages the OpenCellID API, a global crowd-sourced cell site database, to determine which telecom operator offers superior coverage in specific Edinburgh geographical areas. Users can select from five predefined zones and employ toggle buttons for data filtering by technology and operator. Subsequently, data retrieval occurs based on user preferences, followed by enriching the data with human-readable operator names derived from Mobile Network Codes (MNC). The analysis groups the number of telecom towers as an indicator of coverage and generates a heatmap where red signifies robust coverage, while blue indicates lower coverage.

The findings reveal varying coverage across locations, technologies, and operators. O2 and Vodafone exhibit strong LTE signal strength in areas like George Square and New Town, indicative of dense cell tower networks, although Fountainbridge may experience comparatively weaker coverage. EE showcases variable coverage, with strength in locales such as Old Town and sections of Southside, but weaker performance in areas like Fountainbridge and sections of New Town. On the other hand, 3 generally demonstrates weaker signal strength in multiple analyzed areas, including central zones like George Square and Old Town.

As conclusion, considering strengthening coverage in areas with weaker signals, such as Fountainbridge. Additionally, a strategic expansion of LTE network infrastructure, as seen with O2 and Vodafone, can enhance overall service quality and customer satisfaction.
