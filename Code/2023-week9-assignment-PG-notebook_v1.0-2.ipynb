You might also want to save results of your API calls in a file, so you do not need to re-run your API calls, if you do many of them, or if API limits the number of calls per hour.\n",

Also can you formulate a clear answer to the question you created?\n",

    "\n",
    "**C) Visualisation:** Can you aid your argument/aswer with visual clues? Graph can say a thousand words, but it is also easy to make one which is confusing, or misleading. Use simple (or highly customised) graphs to make your argument clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**D) Code Quality:** Is your code clean, readable and DRY (Don't repeat yourself)? Are you using good readable variable names? Did you clean up your code and does it not include enay old/unused parts?\n",
    "\n",
    "**E) Code Structure:** Is your code well structured and broken down? Just like good writing has sentences, paragraphs and chapters, good code should be split into sections. Breakdown your code into cells and functions. Use meaningful signposts (eg. comments, function names) to guide the reader through your code.\n",

    "This analysis leverages the OpenCellID API, a global crowd-sourced cell site database, to determine which telecom operator offers superior coverage in specific Edinburgh geographical areas. Users can select from five predefined zones and employ toggle buttons for data filtering by technology and operator. Subsequently, data retrieval occurs based on user preferences, followed by enriching the data with human-readable operator names derived from Mobile Network Codes (MNC). The analysis groups the number of telecom towers as an indicator of coverage and generates a heatmap where red signifies robust coverage, while blue indicates lower coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings reveal varying coverage across locations, technologies, and operators. O2 and Vodafone exhibit strong LTE signal strength in areas like George Square and New Town, indicative of dense cell tower networks, although Fountainbridge may experience comparatively weaker coverage. EE showcases variable coverage, with strength in locales such as Old Town and sections of Southside, but weaker performance in areas like Fountainbridge and sections of New Town. On the other hand, 3 generally demonstrates weaker signal strength in multiple analyzed areas, including central zones like George Square and Old Town.\n",
    "\n",
    "As conclusion, considering strengthening coverage in areas with weaker signals, such as Fountainbridge. Additionally, a strategic expansion of LTE network infrastructure, as seen with O2 and Vodafone, can enhance overall service quality and customer satisfaction."
